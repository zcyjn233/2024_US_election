## Overview
This project aims to forecast the 2024 U.S. presidential election by analyzing polling data focused on Donald Trump. Our goal is to understand how different polling methodologies—such as sampling approaches, demographic weighting, and likely voter models—impact the accuracy of election predictions. Using high-quality polling data, custom R code for data cleaning and analysis, and an idealized survey design, we assess key factors influencing voter sentiment and forecast accuracy.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the auto-complete tool, ChatGPT. Part of the coding were written with the help of ChatGPT and the entire chat history is available in other/llms/usage.txt.
